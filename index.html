			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I'm SpaceNeb, you probably know me from some of the projects I'm working on. I made this website in a weekend out of bordem. If you couldn't tell, I *really* like retro tech. Sadly, I didn't grow up in the 90s, I grew up in the 2000s. Probably one of the best things about growing up in the 2000s was easy access to GUN/Linux. When I was about 8, YouTube was fairly popular so I had been watching more YouTube than TV. I quickly found out what GNU/Linux was and I installed it on my Compaq desktop. (I actually still have it to this day). My favorite color is definitely <span style="color: #68FFB1;">this one</span>. I don't know why, I just really like those natural greens mixed with 'high-tech'. I used to have a dog but she passed away a few years ago ;-( . If you didn't know my fox actually has a name, 愛顧, which means beloved little one, how beautiful!</p>
