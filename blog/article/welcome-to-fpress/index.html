I honestly got inspired by my good friend easrng, she created her own blogging software from the ground up called Maylog. I think it's an amazing take on blogs in general and is quite lightweight. I basically came up with the name because I was like fuck Wordpress. One of the great things about my solution, unlike Wordpress, it is entirely client side HTML/CSS with a sprinkle of JavaScript. JavaScript isn't even required, it's for the optional search and for the counter at the footer of this webpage. Maylog is a really cool idea kind of like Medium (kind of). You basically create blog entries by sending an email to the bot and it will be published to her domain <a href="https://easrng.us.to">easrng.us.to</a> and anyone can view it and share it. Yeah, my blog isn't as sexy but that's the point. It also doesn't require a backend. Or even logins. If I wanted to I could host this on a waterproof cellphone dropped in a public bathroom's toilet water tank. I could edit this anywhere in the world and just FTP/commit the files to a server. I probably won't officialy release the code because this is too niche, but you could always yank it off my GitHub Repo. Anyway, this is MY solution to the blogging epidemic.</p>
